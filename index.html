									<!---<h2>Current peer-review system hurts Science</h2>--->
									<p>There are two major problems with science publishing today: (1) restricted access and (2) poor and delayed peer review process. While the former is being solved by: (a) encouraging open access publications with higher publication fees and (b) providing access in violation of copyright acts (eg. Sci-Hub). The latter issue with peer review is a more difficult problem to tackle. This is where BioPeers, an initiative by the researchers and for the researchers, comes to rescue science!</p>

									<!--- <h2>How BioPeers solves these shortcomings?</h2> --->
									<p>Peer review is important for publishing good science. However, the process is often very slow and poor. If it slows down publication time and the time-taking review still doesn't improve the quality of work, it really becomes counterproductive and beats the purpose of it. Firstly, peer-review isn't an organised endeavour - there is no central repository of reviewers, for instance. Secondly, in the multi-billion scientific publishing business, there is no incentive for peer reviewers (who are central to this!) to do good work. From a game theory perspective, such a system with no reward/ punishment for good/ bad behavior, will never work efficiently. We introduce incentive to specifically improve the quality and speed of peer reviewing. This is the first marketplace to hire subject experts for peer review. At the moment, peer review can be summarised as a necessary evil in science. With BioPeers, it doesn't have to be evil anymore.</li>

							<h2>FAQs</h2>
							<p>Some of the most common questions that we received from the community include:
							<li><b>How is the incentive calculated and how does it improve quality and speed of the review?</b></li>
							The incentive for the reviewer decreases as the the quality of work decreases or the time taken to complete the work increases. We discuss the algorith in detail in <a href="https://biopeers.medium.com/biopeers-the-future-of-peer-review-in-science-8f34cb9da61b" target="_blank" class="button scrolly">our blog post</a></p>

							<p><li><b>How is BioPeers owned by the participating researchers? And what does this ownership entail?</b></li>
								The tokens would also be associated with governance right on the platform. This would mean that reviewers who hold on to the tokens (without selling them on the market) would be <i>democratically</i> able to submit proposals and vote using their tokens to change the rules of the platform.
								Moreover, in the future these holders might receive additional rights such as the ability to vote and distribute small grants from the treasury to good scientific causes and projects.</a></p>

							<p><li><b>As a researcher/ editor, how can I get involved?</b></li>
								As a researcher, there are two ways to get involved:
								<br>(i) BioPeers ambassador program: open to all. The ambassadors will help us spread the word. You will receive an exclusive ambassador badge NFT for this. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJJLjvNYtbcBCF7fAbMnMI-TYjXm9Vk7TlYu7ORt5OkW68Kw/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank" class="button scrolly">Sign-up here to be an ambassador.</a>
								<br>(ii) BioPeers reviewer program: selected individuals will be added to the reviewer pool of the BioPeers platform. Open to PhD-holders. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdb53UQj_TzgmO6yTHWe35dbweJa7B8Ka1BdVlev7umnWcQyA/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank" class="button scrolly">Sign-up here to be a reviewer.</a>
								<br>As an editor, this is a unique opportunity as we will provide tokens and help onboard only one journal to our beta platform before it open to others. So, if you’re interested, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbieypdAyVRdF3M2nix0lNCSsbJjtJ1NVqDsPLXgV64AfjRQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank" class="button scrolly"> write to us using this form. </a>
								</p>

							<p><li><b>I am not a researcher in biology but interested to contribute - how do I participate?</b></li>
								If you’re a blockchain developer and want to contribute, write to us directly at: contact.biopeers[at]gmail[dot]com
								<br>As a non-profit initiative, we will not be participating in any equity-sharing fundraising. We are self-funded (a group of researchers spread across Europe). However, if you believe in the cause and want to contribute - we will be glad accept donations in the form of BTC/ETH/DOT. Our addresses are provided below:
								<br>BTC: 1CfuTac32udceW9JL6NZuHDRwMtFqai7tF
